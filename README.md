# Personal website
 
This HTML and CSS website is the first project made on my own. As I don't have any other jobs to show, I made this one to introduce myself and show what I have learned in my studies.

All begins with pure HTML then get on to CSS styles and layouts. The main idea is to build the website in the same order I started my study. As a dev culture says, everything starts with a simple Hello World and it will be no different here.
